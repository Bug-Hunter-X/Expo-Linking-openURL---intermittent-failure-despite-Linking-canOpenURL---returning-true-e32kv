# Expo Linking Intermittent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo's `Linking` API for deep linking. The `Linking.openURL()` method intermittently fails to open a URL, even though `Linking.canOpenURL()` correctly indicates that the URL should be openable. The behavior is inconsistent and lacks clear patterns.

## Bug Description

The primary issue involves attempting to open a custom URL scheme using `Linking.openURL()`. The URL often fails to open in the associated application despite `Linking.canOpenURL()` returning `true`. This occurs on both Android and iOS.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using `expo start`.
3. Observe the inconsistent behavior of `Linking.openURL()`.

## Solution

A solution to mitigate this issue has been implemented in `bugSolution.js`, incorporating a delay before attempting to open the URL. This suggests potential issues with timing or race conditions within the Expo runtime environment when handling URL opening requests.

## Additional Notes

The exact cause of the issue remains unclear. Additional investigation might be required to determine the root cause and provide a more robust solution. Future Expo updates may address this inherent timing issue.
