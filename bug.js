While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's `Linking` API and deep linking.  The issue manifested when attempting to open a specific URL scheme using `Linking.openURL()`. The URL would fail to open in the associated app, yet the `Linking.canOpenURL()` method correctly reported that the URL *could* be opened. The error was inconsistent, sometimes working and sometimes not, without clear patterns in the behavior.  I've included a code snippet that demonstrates the problem, focusing on attempts to open a custom URL scheme registered in the app's configuration.
